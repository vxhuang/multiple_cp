Multiple changepoint detection

example.R shows two examples. The first is a times series with 2 changepoints, and the second is a times series with 1 changepoints. This algorithm can differentiate them pretty accurately. 

amtc.R is an algorithm designed to detect changepoints from time series with at most two changepoints. 

Please refer to `Introduction to ATMC Algorithm.pdf` for details.
