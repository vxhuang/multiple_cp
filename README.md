Multiple changepoint detection

amtc.R is an algorithm designed detect changepoints from time series with at most two changepoints. 
example.R shows two examples. The first is a times series with 2 changepoints, and the second is a times series with 1 changepoints. This algorithm can differentiate them pretty accurately.
